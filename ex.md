# SQL Lesson 4: Filtering and sorting Query results

- to remove duplicate rows

```
SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s);
```

- order by by default it is asc

- limit 5 - gives top 5

- limit 2 offset 2 (first 2 skipped then 2 displayed)

- SYntax for limit and offset:
```
SELECT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```


1. List all directors of Pixar movies (alphabetically), without duplicates âœ“
